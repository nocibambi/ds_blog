When you are thinking about what business area to pursue, it is useful to focus on your specific situation and circumstance. 

# Why is it useful to find a specialization?

When you do not look at your own specificities, you basically do not use knowledge and skills that others could use but cannot.

You have your history, your dis/abilities, your interests, and your own conceptual framing. Most of it might be useless, especially regarding all the people in the world.

However, there are a few problems which maybe you are the only one who can solve it.

This is not about 'finding your passion' but rather to find out your skills, knowledge, approach, etc. These are actually quite tangible.

# How to know your specificities?

To see yourself better, write down your characteristics in as many dimensions as possible.

Here are some dimensions which you can look for:
- Knowledge,
- Skills,
- Experience,
- Interest.

One thing you can do is to create a spreadsheet and write as many of these things as possible. Then, value them on a scale (e.g., 1-5) showing how specific these traits and dimensions are to you, especially compared to others.
