title: How to build up a writing habit?

---
If you tend to analyze a lot but want to build up a consistent writing habit, the following tips might help.

# Take notes

Have a notepad or a very light-weight text editor/app that you can open at any time and dump your ideas effortlessly.

# Find out what interests you

Review your notes, todo lists, emails, past writing, or any other traces about yourself. Look for frequent themes about which you feel strongly and, even better, about which you developed some depth in skill or knowledge.

# Prioritize your themes

Take these themes and group or merge the closely related ones. Then, prioritize them based on their importance. 

When you have them ranked, drop the last 80% and focus on the remaining 20%. If you have too too many themes remained (e.g., more than 10), drop even more.

# Brainstorm post ideas 

For each remaining theme, write as many post ideas as possible, but a minimum of ten. Do not bother with how good or viable they are. The important thing is to have a high number of them.

# Rotate your themes

Now you have a list of topics organized under themes. Outline a rotating schedule where you order the themes into a sequence, so, in each day, you write about a topic belonging to the next theme. 

# Write

Each day, you take the topics belonging under that day's theme and pick one randomly. Write about it impatiently, badly, and experimentally for a minimum 5 minutes.

When you find that you could write about multiple things but you do not know which to pick, pick the first one and move the second into your ideas under the same theme.

When you run out of time, you will find yourself wanting to write more about something. Move it as a new topic under the same theme.

# Publish

Publish the writing to somewhere, where nobody sees is. For example, create an account on Medium or any blogging platform under some alias.

# Repeat

When you arrive at the end of the sequence, start again. If you could fill out all your 5 minutes for each day for a week, add an extra 5 minutes for your writing time.
