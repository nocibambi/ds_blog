With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

            "content": "I take notes . I take lots of notes. Many of them are ideas to research, explore, and think about, while others are rather tasks or possible projects. . As I collect them continuously, their number grows. After a while, it becomes hard to look through them and prioritize for action. . The obvious way to do this, of course, is to categorize them under topics or themes. . Concept hierarchies . This produces a hierarchical tree-like structure. There a few problems with this: . There always be some idea or task which does not belong to a single category alone but under multiple ones. | As the number of notes and, therefore, the number of categories and sub-categories becomes high, you need to dig very deep to find some notes. If the hierarchies are obvious, this is not really a problem. However, as the number of hierarchy levels and branches grow, the previous issue (i.e., notes belonging under multiple categories) become even more prominent. | . Concept drift . There is also the problem of concept drift. While we refer to a particular thing or category with a specific term, later on, we start to refer to it with a related but different one. Similarly, we do the same with categories. . This shift can happen for multiple reasons, but the most obvious ones are terminological shifts or our changing ‘use’ of the original idea or category. . Concept drift, deep hierarchies, and the overlapping category boundaries can lead to the ‘forgetting’ of notes. They can also lead to making multiple, ‘almost similar’ but ‘slightly different’ versions of them at different places of the hierarchy. . And, even whether the relationship between two ideas should be hierarchical or not also can change from use case to use case. . Chaos everywhere . And note-taking is just the most obvious example for me. I had the same experience with software development (both as writing code and managing versions), technical writing, academic research, work organization, file organization, etc. .",

            "content": "I thought further about my previous position on whether stock trading is a zero-sum game. Now I see a bigger space for it not to be one. . Trading growth stocks . The situation I am thinking about is an argument I found during my google search. . Very simply, one buys a stock at one point in time and sells it to someone else in another. . Let’s take the ‘classical’ position on stocks and consider it merely an investment asset. In this case, we can argue that stock buyers lent money to a company in exchange for a part of its profits. They sell the stocks when it wants to get their money back, say for their retirement. . Here the value comes for the original owner in that the price will be higher when they sell. . This is the same hope the sellers have for the time when they want to realize their investment. That is, when the original buyers sell the stock, the new buyers can get a ‘fair’ price if, in that given time, the stock is still promising some price growth. . This seems more positive-sum for me. However, this view works if we strip away the ‘speculative’ (?), arbitrage-seeking trading aspect of security trading. In this view, stock trading seems to resemble the trade of a good tool one does not need anymore. . Remaining questions . There are, of course, a number of issues still unclear for me. . The first is whether ‘speculation’ or ‘arbitrage seeking’ inevitably leads to a zero-sum outcome? Also, can we separate ‘straightforward’ investment from these activities? . The next is about the buying price: when is the price too high/low? . The buyer could always want to ask for a higher price. Aren’t selling a stock at a too high price basically strips away the seller’s possible gains? . On the other hand, one might argue that, if the price reflects the market price, there is less space for unfairness (or at least not directly between the two parties). . Third, there is the question of whether a company can grow infinitely or trading stock is always based on this false promise. . Finally, how do we calculate the outcomes when the ‘gain’, in big part, comes from luck and decisions made years before their realization. .",

            "content": "If you tend to analyze a lot but want to build up a consistent writing habit, the following tips might help. . Take notes . Have a notepad or a very light-weight text editor/app that you can open at any time and dump your ideas effortlessly. . Find out what interests you . Review your notes, todo lists, emails, past writing, or any other traces about yourself. Look for frequent themes about which you feel strongly and, even better, about which you developed some depth in skill or knowledge. . Prioritize your themes . Take these themes and group or merge the closely related ones. Then, prioritize them based on their importance. . When you have them ranked, drop the last 80% and focus on the remaining 20%. If you have too too many themes remained (e.g., more than 10), drop even more. . Brainstorm post ideas . For each remaining theme, write as many post ideas as possible, but a minimum of ten. Do not bother with how good or viable they are. The important thing is to have a high number of them. . Rotate your themes . Now you have a list of topics organized under themes. Outline a rotating schedule where you order the themes into a sequence, so, in each day, you write about a topic belonging to the next theme. . Write . Each day, you take the topics belonging under that day’s theme and pick one randomly. Write about it impatiently, badly, and experimentally for a minimum 5 minutes. . When you find that you could write about multiple things but you do not know which to pick, pick the first one and move the second into your ideas under the same theme. . When you run out of time, you will find yourself wanting to write more about something. Move it as a new topic under the same theme. . Publish . Publish the writing to somewhere, where nobody sees is. For example, create an account on Medium or any blogging platform under some alias. . Repeat . When you arrive at the end of the sequence, start again. If you could fill out all your 5 minutes for each day for a week, add an extra 5 minutes for your writing time. .",

            "content": "I recently thought about finance and whether it is a purely zero-sum game or has some value-add to it. I would like to know this to see if it is worthy of support either as a personal wealth source or as a social institution. . I did not have time to read academic papers, so I simply did a google search (1-2 hours) and reviewed the top results. . What I found . Just based on this short research, I barely found any substantial arguments against the zero-sum claim. . What counterarguments I found were acknowledged that some forms, like forex or short-term trading, are zero-sum. They argued that, compared to the former types, ‘real’ stock trading can bring about benefits for both parties. Most of these were conflating terminology and concepts (like ‘luck’, or ‘value growth’). . There are probably more substantial arguments in academic literature. Also, probably, there is the additional question of the social usefulness of financial markets for overall capital allocation, but that’s a separate thing. . How I see it now . Of course, as I started to dive into the topic, I quickly realized that is is a bit more complex than I thought. . So let’s break up the question to the following cases: . Pure commercial relationship | Trading of goods | Finance | . Pure commercial transaction . When two people get into a commercial relationship, one is a ‘seller’, and the other is a ‘buyer’. Regarding the price, they have opposite aims. One’s income is another’s cost. . So, in this sense, every commercial transaction is zero-sum. . Trade of ‘comparatively advantageous’ goods . When the seller gives away something they cannot use, but the buyer can, the exchange might benefit both. There is still the issue of the price for which they exchange the good, but the buyer’s benefit from possessing the good might surpass its price. . So, here we can imagine a non-zero-sum relationship. . Finance . Most of the people who trade and invest mostly want to get the most payoff for their buck. So this primarily seems zero-sum. . The mutual benefit might come about when their relationship to their asset is more complex than just trying to get the highest price difference. . Conclusion . Again, I can see that I could think and write about this topic for a long time. Some ideas . How do we measure and compare ‘comparatively advantages’? | What are examples of not purely ‘buy low, sell high’ uses of finance? | How to measure the utility ‘ratio’ between price gain/loss and usability of the result of a buy event? | Is the social benefit of efficient capital distribution via financial markets a fluke, or has empirical evidence behind it? | Can we replace financial markets with an AI and delegate human creativity to more productive things? | .",

Current technologies of valuation are in place because of different reasons. However, implementers rarely take into account the way the given technology plays a role in valuing things. . Examples of the use of technology in valuation and some trends . Money is arguably the most prominent example. Probably this is not independent of that most of us still do not really understand all its effects. . Other examples are in accountancy, trade, work management, economic metrics, environmental management. . An obvious note is that, of course, other, not strictly technological components, like language, moral values, physical factors, etc., also have critial roles. . Think about and experiment with different technologies to generate new valuation situations . Accordingly, it might be beneficial to try out technologies with explicit valuation functions in mind. . For the most part, and especially in early stages, this is concept-driven (i.e., we are looking for a particular effect to emerge). However, an uncertain but promising benefit would be discovering ‘unthought’ features due to things’ specific and idiosyncratic character. . The process of valuation technology experiments and its main challenges . Most of the time, we cannot implement large scale infrastructures for the sake of experimentation. . Instead, we can try other paths: . Implementation of a small-scale but very focused version | Scenario building | Simulation | Game development | The empirical analysis of similar processes | The empirical analysis of current technologies’ edge cases | Speculation | Incremental implementation | . Current action possibilities and possible future directions . As, currently, I this all is very high level and conceptual, and I am also mostly interested in discovery activities: .

Then I spend a considerable amount of time organizing them. . One common frustration with organizing notes is that I can do this only along one hierarchical dimension. . Perhaps one reason I like to code is that you can implement hierarchies along multiple dimensions more easily, although not always. . Because of the single hierarchy, some notes tend to become forgotten as I put them in some deep end part of a category branch. This then requires me to constantly re- and review my notes and to recategorize and reorganize them. . I have looked into multiple note-taking software, but there is not really a perfect solution for this. . One thing I found helpful is to require only a single function from a particular tool. So, for instance, I would use one particular tool or process for note-taking, then another for categorization, and perhaps a further one for review or note management. . This, however, needs that the different tools speak to each other relatively well. Ready-made solutions often do not allow it, so I found myself moving toward text-based tools.
