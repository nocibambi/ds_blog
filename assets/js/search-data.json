Why is it useful to find a specialization? . When you do not look at your own specificities, you basically do not use knowledge and skills that others could use but cannot. . You have your history, your dis/abilities, your interests, and your own conceptual framing. Most of it might be useless, especially regarding all the people in the world. . However, there are a few problems which maybe you are the only one who can solve it. . This is not about ‘finding your passion’ but rather to find out your skills, knowledge, approach, etc. These are actually quite tangible. . How to know your specificities? . To see yourself better, write down your characteristics in as many dimensions as possible. . Here are some dimensions which you can look for: . Knowledge, | Skills, | Experience, | Interest. | . One thing you can do is to create a spreadsheet and write as many of these things as possible. Then, value them on a scale (e.g., 1-5) showing how specific these traits and dimensions are to you, especially compared to others. .",

            "content": "Valuation technology experimentation . It might be useful and promising to experiment with technologies of valuation. . How does valuation happen now, and how does technology play a role in it? . Current technologies of valuation are in place because of different reasons. However, implementers rarely take into account the way the given technology plays a role in valuing things. . Examples of the use of technology in valuation and some trends . Money is arguably the most prominent example. Probably this is not independent of that most of us still do not really understand all its effects. . Other examples are in accountancy, trade, work management, economic metrics, environmental management. . An obvious note is that, of course, other, not strictly technological components, like language, moral values, physical factors, etc., also have critial roles. . Think about and experiment with different technologies to generate new valuation situations . Accordingly, it might be beneficial to try out technologies with explicit valuation functions in mind. . For the most part, and especially in early stages, this is concept-driven (i.e., we are looking for a particular effect to emerge). However, an uncertain but promising benefit would be discovering ‘unthought’ features due to things’ specific and idiosyncratic character. . The process of valuation technology experiments and its main challenges . Most of the time, we cannot implement large scale infrastructures for the sake of experimentation. . Instead, we can try other paths: . Implementation of a small-scale but very focused version | Scenario building | Simulation | Game development | The empirical analysis of similar processes | The empirical analysis of current technologies’ edge cases | Speculation | Incremental implementation | . Current action possibilities and possible future directions . As, currently, I this all is very high level and conceptual, and I am also mostly interested in discovery activities: . Collecting ideas | Conceptual exploration of background ideas | Case study analysis | Code experimentations | . In the future, I might be able to focus it down and branch out toward more serious development work. .",

            "content": "Note-taking obsessions . I have an obsession with the process of note-taking. . I often write down my ideas in the form of notes or tasks. I do this through multiple channels. Then I spend a considerable amount of time organizing them. . One common frustration with organizing notes is that I can do this only along one hierarchical dimension. . Perhaps one reason I like to code is that you can implement hierarchies along multiple dimensions more easily, although not always. . Because of the single hierarchy, some notes tend to become forgotten as I put them in some deep end part of a category branch. This then requires me to constantly re- and review my notes and to recategorize and reorganize them. . I have looked into multiple note-taking software, but there is not really a perfect solution for this. . One thing I found helpful is to require only a single function from a particular tool. So, for instance, I would use one particular tool or process for note-taking, then another for categorization, and perhaps a further one for review or note management. . This, however, needs that the different tools speak to each other relatively well. Ready-made solutions often do not allow it, so I found myself moving toward text-based tools. However, you need to utilize some basic scripting to make them work. .",
