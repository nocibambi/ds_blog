            "content": "Valuation technology experimentation . It might be useful and promising to experiment with technologies of valuation. . How does valuation happen now, and how does technology play a role in it? . Current technologies of valuation are in place because of different reasons. However, implementers rarely take into account the way the given technology plays a role in valuing things. . Examples of the use of technology in valuation and some trends . Money is arguably the most prominent example. Probably this is not independent of that most of us still do not really understand all its effects. . Other examples are in accountancy, trade, work management, economic metrics, environmental management. . An obvious note is that, of course, other, not strictly technological components, like language, moral values, physical factors, etc., also have critial roles. . Think about and experiment with different technologies to generate new valuation situations . Accordingly, it might be beneficial to try out technologies with explicit valuation functions in mind. . For the most part, and especially in early stages, this is concept-driven (i.e., we are looking for a particular effect to emerge). However, an uncertain but promising benefit would be discovering ‘unthought’ features due to things’ specific and idiosyncratic character. . The process of valuation technology experiments and its main challenges . Most of the time, we cannot implement large scale infrastructures for the sake of experimentation. . Instead, we can try other paths: . Implementation of a small-scale but very focused version | Scenario building | Simulation | Game development | The empirical analysis of similar processes | The empirical analysis of current technologies’ edge cases | Speculation | Incremental implementation | . Current action possibilities and possible future directions . As, currently, I this all is very high level and conceptual, and I am also mostly interested in discovery activities: . Collecting ideas | Conceptual exploration of background ideas | Case study analysis | Code experimentations | . In the future, I might be able to focus it down and branch out toward more serious development work. .",

            "content": "Note-taking obsessions . I have an obsession with the process of note-taking. . I often write down my ideas in the form of notes or tasks. I do this through multiple channels. Then I spend a considerable amount of time organizing them. . One common frustration with organizing notes is that I can do this only along one hierarchical dimension. . Perhaps one reason I like to code is that you can implement hierarchies along multiple dimensions more easily, although not always. . Because of the single hierarchy, some notes tend to become forgotten as I put them in some deep end part of a category branch. This then requires me to constantly re- and review my notes and to recategorize and reorganize them. . I have looked into multiple note-taking software, but there is not really a perfect solution for this. . One thing I found helpful is to require only a single function from a particular tool. So, for instance, I would use one particular tool or process for note-taking, then another for categorization, and perhaps a further one for review or note management. . This, however, needs that the different tools speak to each other relatively well. Ready-made solutions often do not allow it, so I found myself moving toward text-based tools. However, you need to utilize some basic scripting to make them work. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc:true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . .
