&lt;p&gt;When you are thinking about what business area to pursue, it is useful to focus on your specific situation and circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-it-useful-to-find-a-specialization&quot;&gt;Why is it useful to find a specialization?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do not look at your own specificities, you basically do not use knowledge and skills that others could use but cannot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have your history, your dis/abilities, your interests, and your own conceptual framing. Most of it might be useless, especially regarding all the people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few problems which maybe you are the only one who can solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not about ‘finding your passion’ but rather to find out your skills, knowledge, approach, etc. These are actually quite tangible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-know-your-specificities&quot;&gt;How to know your specificities?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see yourself better, write down your characteristics in as many dimensions as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some dimensions which you can look for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Knowledge,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skills,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experience,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you can do is to create a spreadsheet and write as many of these things as possible. Then, value them on a scale (e.g., 1-5) showing how specific these traits and dimensions are to you, especially compared to others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The specific you</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Valuation technology experimentation</title><link href="andrasnovoszath.com/technology/valuation/experimentation/2020/09/15/technnology_valuation_experimentation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Valuation technology experimentation" /><published>2020-09-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-09-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>andrasnovoszath.com/technology/valuation/experimentation/2020/09/15/technnology_valuation_experimentation</id><content type="html" xml:base="andrasnovoszath.com/technology/valuation/experimentation/2020/09/15/technnology_valuation_experimentation.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;valuation-technology-experimentation&quot;&gt;Valuation technology experimentation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be useful and promising to experiment with technologies of valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-valuation-happen-now-and-how-does-technology-play-a-role-in-it&quot;&gt;How does valuation happen now, and how does technology play a role in it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current technologies of valuation are in place because of different reasons. However, implementers rarely take into account the way the given technology plays a role in valuing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;examples-of-the-use-of-technology-in-valuation-and-some-trends&quot;&gt;Examples of the use of technology in valuation and some trends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money is arguably the most prominent example. Probably this is not independent of that most of us still do not really understand all its effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other examples are in accountancy, trade, work management, economic metrics, environmental management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An obvious note is that, of course, other, not strictly technological components, like language, moral values, physical factors, etc., also have critial roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;think-about-and-experiment-with-different-technologies-to-generate-new-valuation-situations&quot;&gt;Think about and experiment with different technologies to generate new valuation situations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, it might be beneficial to try out technologies with explicit valuation functions in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, and especially in early stages, this is concept-driven (i.e., we are looking for a particular effect to emerge). However, an uncertain but promising benefit would be discovering ‘unthought’ features due to things’ specific and idiosyncratic character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-process-of-valuation-technology-experiments-and-its-main-challenges&quot;&gt;The process of valuation technology experiments and its main challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, we cannot implement large scale infrastructures for the sake of experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, we can try other paths:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Implementation of a small-scale but very focused version&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scenario building&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simulation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Game development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The empirical analysis of similar processes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The empirical analysis of current technologies’ edge cases&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speculation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incremental implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-action-possibilities-and-possible-future-directions&quot;&gt;Current action possibilities and possible future directions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As, currently, I this all is very high level and conceptual, and I am also mostly interested in discovery activities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collecting ideas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conceptual exploration of background ideas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Case study analysis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Code experimentations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, I might be able to focus it down and branch out toward more serious development work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Valuation technology experimentation</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Note-taking obsessions</title><link href="andrasnovoszath.com/note-taking/2020/09/14/note-taking-obsessions.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Note-taking obsessions" /><published>2020-09-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-09-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>andrasnovoszath.com/note-taking/2020/09/14/note-taking-obsessions</id><content type="html" xml:base="andrasnovoszath.com/note-taking/2020/09/14/note-taking-obsessions.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;note-taking-obsessions&quot;&gt;Note-taking obsessions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an obsession with the process of note-taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often write down my ideas in the form of notes or tasks. I do this through multiple channels. Then I spend a considerable amount of time organizing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One common frustration with organizing notes is that I can do this only along one hierarchical dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one reason I like to code is that you can implement hierarchies along multiple dimensions more easily, although not always.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the single hierarchy, some notes tend to become forgotten as I put them in some deep end part of a category branch. This then requires me to constantly re- and review my notes and to recategorize and reorganize them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have looked into multiple note-taking software, but there is not really a perfect solution for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I found helpful is to require only a single function from a particular tool. So, for instance, I would use one particular tool or process for note-taking, then another for categorization, and perhaps a further one for review or note management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, however, needs that the different tools speak to each other relatively well. Ready-made solutions often do not allow it, so I found myself moving toward text-based tools. However, you need to utilize some basic scripting to make them work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Note-taking obsessions I have an obsession with the process of note-taking.</summary></entry></feed>
